# Movie Discovery Spec

The movies discovery page is like the apple app store UX.

There's a featured section of the top 5 popular movies.

Then there's a carousel the rest of the popular movies.

Then there's a carousel for a bunch of genres, like:

- Action
- Adventure
- Comedy
- Drama
- Horror
- Romance
- Sci-Fi
- Thriller

Each genre has a list of popular movies in that genre.

Clicking on a movie opens a popup with more details and the option to download.
